  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <a>Petal is a platform that makes "making a difference" more accessible to those that want to do "more"</a>

  <h2>That didn't explain anything.</h2>
  <a>Inspired by the virality of Wordle, Petal is a simple word game people can play anytime they have a spare 5 minutes on their phone or their computer. But there's more to it than that.</a>

  <h2>Get on with it my dude!</h2>
  <a>100% of the ad revenue from this website will be donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds. An organization that makes supporting abortion clinics much easier and helps you make sure the money you donate goes to those who need it.</a>
  <br>
  <a>This may not end up having an impact but it can only do good. And if a fraction of the people that participated in other viral treds play Petal for a month we can provide local clinics with thousands of dollars to ensure women across America have safe, reliable, and affordable access to support.</a>

  <h2>The Long Term</h2>
  <a>If this only raises a couple hundred dollars, if this only raises ten dollars, I will still be proud and will continue to work towards a world where women's personal freedoms are not revoked. One day maybe the mission of Petal will shift, if a large enough community is built this could have the power to impact hundreds of thousands of lives affected by injustice. But that is just the dream that I have to work towards to make reality</a>
